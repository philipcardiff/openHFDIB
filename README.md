## Port Notes

This port is maintained by Philip Cardiff, UCD. The original toolbox includes
 the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE; however, as the code builds on OpenFOAM
 it must be released under the GPLv3 license or later. The GPLv3 terms state
 that any derivative work must remain under GPLv3. Consequently, the license has
 been updated to GPLv3 in this repository.
